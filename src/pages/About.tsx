            I am a 21-year-old front-end web developer, born in Turkmenistan,
            and currently living in Istanbul, Turkey. My education includes
            attending No:42 High School in Ashgabat. I am a passionate and
            driven junior front-end web developer with over 8 months of
            experience in the field. I possess strong skills in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and React. I am constantly seeking to expand my
            knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest web development
            trends. With a keen eye for detail and a dedication to delivering
            top-notch results, I am eager to contribute my expertise to projects
            and collaborate with a dynamic team of professionals.
